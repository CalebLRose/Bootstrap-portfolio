<!-- I did not allow enough time for this, and I'm not happy with the outcome. Bootstrap is something that I thought made sense to me. However, once I got into it, I realized I find it harder than jusr writing the CSS myself with media queries. I didn't dig deep enough into the documentation to fully understand how to add labels for the pictures on the Portfolio page, add finishing touches to the main content and side bar, or collapse the menu in order not to fill the whole screen in small viewports.  -->

              <p>Hi, My name is Caleb Rose. I've lived a few places, all in Texas. Houston is where I came into this world but, it wasn't long until we made our first move. My mother and I moved down to Laredo, Tx in 1991. We stayed there until September of 1999 when we moved to a small East Texas town called Kilgore. It was a nice place to finish school. I made a lot of good friends there who I still keep in touch with today. After high school, I moved to San Antonio. I guess I just missed South Texas. Then after about a year there I moved to Austin. Austin is an interesting place. I loved it there, felt at home there. However, it is easy to burn out in Austin and, that is just what I did. It was a fun time.</p>
              <p>I also have a fairly diverse work background. I've worked in construction, live sound and studio recording, even opened a coffee shop with some friends. There is so much that is interesting in this world and I never wanted to choose just one. I really like to learn. One year my mom took out a small loan to get us a set of encyclopedias. I still think it might have been the best gift ever.</p>
              <p>Music will always be my first love. I've had a guitar for as long as I remember. When middle school band came around, I really wanted to play the Tumpet. Unfortunately there were quite a few other kids that beat me to it. I ended up playing Bassoon, a double reeded supersized oboe. I spent all of high school and most of my 20s in and out of different bands, mostly playing guitar and bass. I eventually had my folk revival period where just me and an acoustic guitar sufficed. Now, on the music front, changed paths again. This happened after, on a whim, I purchased my first synthesizer. With this a new obsession was born.</p>
